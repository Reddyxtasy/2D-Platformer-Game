# 2D-Platformer-Game
This is a 2D platformer game I developed using Unity, featuring smooth character movement, responsive controls, dynamic obstacles, and engaging level design. The game emphasizes player experience with carefully crafted mechanics such as jump physics, enemy AI, collectible systems, and background music integration.
